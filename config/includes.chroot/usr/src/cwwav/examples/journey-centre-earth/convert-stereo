# Play with the -p value to get the stereo effect you like best...
# Value is in radians. Meaningful values are 0-3.141.

# The stereo examples are encoded at a higher bitrate and with true
# stereo to prevent artifacts. So they are also twice as big as the
# mono ones. Feel free to play with the Lame settings and if you find
# something else that works well then let me know.
